                <h1>Mobile First Design</h1>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    I don't like writing code twice and so when it comes to mobile apps and websites my first priority is User Experience and
                    Frameworks. For web based solutions I have gravitated towards React and Angular for client side scripting
                    and seperating out my API's into there own solutions. It not only makes it easier for multiple developers
                    but it also breaks out the seperation of duties and creates a clear objective for both the client and
                    the server.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    For mobile app development my go to has been Xamarin. Not only because of the great ability to develop in C# but also due
                    to the fact that I can share my code across Android and iOS.

                <p class="text-justify">
                    Let's face it Agile is done a little bit different for company. I have worked in groups where there is no project manager to
                    groups that have the system analysts do quality assurance. Because of this I don't have a preference
                    as long as we have short cycles where progress is being given back to the customers then I'm pretty happy.
